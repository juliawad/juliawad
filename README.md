Hi, I'm Julia! I am a hard-working, motivated Geography Graduate from the University of Liverpool and achieved a 1st Class BA
Degree in the summer of 2022. I am a reliable individual with a strong work ethic, eager to build and expand upon my
current skill set. Higher education has enhanced my GIS knowledge and data analysis skills in a variety of disciplines
and developed my grasp on real-world business/geography problems where monetary, physical and time limitations
play an important role.

I am proficient in tools like Excel, QGIS, ArcGIS, SPSS, R, and Python (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, TensorFlow) from my academic background. Furthermore, I am developing my knowledge with courses on LinkedIn (SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and AWS). I am eager to learn new things and pursue my career in data. 

Here, I have attached a sample of the work I did through the university. With time, I will be adding projects which utilise my knowledge from courses.
